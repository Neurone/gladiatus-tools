# Welcome to the Gladiatus Tools Translation Schema: here you can find both information about translating GT Firefox Addon and
# the real words to translate. Edit this file with your translation and return to me.
#
# Please note that all lines starting with a # are my comments for you and they referring the text just before them,
# so don't translate those lines.
#
# Translating this document please try to be as "clear" as possible in your language, don't try to do a 
# literal english translation. Also take care translating in-game messages because they will be shown in the web interface,
# so in that case messages length matters! :-)
#
# Please use an editor supporting UTF-8 editing this file. You can use something like NotePad++ or OpenOffice or even Microsoft Word.
# DON'T use something like classic windows notepad because I'll not be able to see your translations.
#
# If you have any duobts, just send me an email at bertone.giuseppe@gmail.com
#
# Let's begin
